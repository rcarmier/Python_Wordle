# Python_Wordle
A wordle clone written in python
The rules are simple:
There is a hidden 5 letter word
You have 6 attempts to guess the word
The progress guide will show if the letter at the position was guessed correctly with a check mark
If the letter at the position is in the hidden word but at a different position, it will show a plus sign
If the letter at the position is wrong and isn't in the hidden word, it will show a red X

The lesson from the source code has a great explanation about functions and for loops among other things in regard to game programming
